## Note on Effect Implementations

The LED effect implementations in this project are:
- **Inspired by** WLED, WLED-MM, and LEDFx projects
- **Reimplemented** for ESP32-P4 platform using ESP-IDF
- **Adapted** for real-time audio reactivity and DDP protocol support
- **Not direct copies** of the original code, but algorithmic implementations
